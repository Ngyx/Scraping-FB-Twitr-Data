Prabu Ramachandran addresses Real Issues in Singapore
November 10 at 11:28 PM ·

Will the PAP government invoke POFMA or FICA against Aljazeera for this article?

If they don't do that, can we assume that this article is factual & truthful with regards to people in Singapore going hungry?

This is the kind of article that you do not see in the local mainstream media, ranked 160th in the world.

The first thing that shocks me is that MSF had downplayed this to the international media by saying that only 4.5% of Singapore's population had faced ""moderate to severe"" food insecurity compared to as much as 14% in other developed countries.

Will a caring government even bother to make such a justification when the statistics are so bad? It's like saying that a dirty Orient Express is not an issue because African ones have it much worse.

Some of you may recall a 2014 article in the BBC which said that as much as 400,000 people in Singapore live on less than $5 a day. What has changed since then even as the country has grown considerably in the past 7 years?

It also shows you how terribly irresponsible this government is by lavishing money on foreigners when so much work needs to be done at home.

Thanks to the lack of statistics, we do not know how much of taxpayers money is being spent on scholarships to foreign students. But it's almost certain that the number runs in the millions. Why can't this amount be given out via ComCare to true blue Singaporeans instead?

And to this group of people, how will they feel when they see the cost of living rising again and again in the span of just a few months? Not only are public transport fares increasing, but also electricity tariffs and soon to be GST as well!

Where is our promise by the PAP made just over a year ago that ""with you, for you?"" Or for that matter, where is our ""Swiss standard of living""?

Coupled with the many screw ups by the 4G leadership team, it is clear that the PAP has lost its moral authority and political change may be coming faster than one can imagine.","Do you find it shocking that in a rich well developed country like Singapore people are going hungry?

(ST, Sep 13) ""MHA says Sedition Act now of limited application and can be repealed""

""The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is seeking to repeal the Sedition Act, which has seen six prosecutions since 1965.

The Sedition (Repeal) Bill was introduced in Parliament on Monday (Sept 13).

The Act criminalises conduct with seditious tendencies, and also empowers the courts to suspend the publication of newspapers containing seditious content and prohibit the circulation of seditious publications.

In existence since 1938, the Act was last used in 2016, in the prosecution of individuals behind The Real Singapore, which had encouraged anti-foreigner sentiment through online posts.

Over the years, new laws have been introduced to deal with concerns in a more targeted and calibrated manner, said MHA.

These include the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019, the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016, the Undesirable Publications Act and the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, as well as specific provisions under the Penal Code.

As such, MHA said the Sedition Act is now of limited application and can be repealed.

However, it added that one aspect of the Act that seeks to ensure social cohesion between different groups continues to be relevant.

The Penal Code, the ministry said, should be amended to ensure this continues to be adequately addressed.

The Sedition Act currently criminalises conduct that promotes feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes.

Disharmony involving religious and racial groups is already covered under other laws, said MHA.

But, if the Act is repealed, there needs to be laws that can deal with disharmony involving groups outside of religious and racial groups.

As such, MHA proposes amendments to the Penal Code, which currently prohibits the making, possession or dissemination of material containing any incitement of violence against others, counselling others to disobey the law, or which is likely to lead to a breach of the peace.

The ministry intends for this to be extended to cover other acts, such as speeches and other verbal communications, but to narrow the scope to require that the offender intended for the violence, disobedience to the law, or breach of the peace to occur, or knew or had reason to believe that these would likely occur.

It will also be amended to clarify that ""counselling disobedience to the law"" includes, but is not limited to, providing instruction, advice, or information that promotes disobedience to the law.

The Bill also seeks to deal with the powers of arrest when the Sedition Act is repealed. Under the Act, offenders can be arrested.

To ensure the police can still act swiftly and effectively, MHA proposes that other offences currently under the Penal Code be amended to be made arrestable ones.

The offences are: the deliberate wounding of any person's religious or racial feelings; the promotion of disharmony between different religious and racial groups and acts which are prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between religious or racial groups and which disturb the public tranquillity; and the making, publication or circulation of material with intent to incite any class of persons to commit an offence against another class of persons.""

In this connection, after reading this – it got me thinking – perhaps I could try to write a guide on what you can or cannot write about in Singapore?

Well, here goes …

… “the deliberate wounding of any person's religious or racial feelings; the promotion of disharmony between different religious and racial groups and acts which are prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between religious or racial groups and which disturb the public tranquillity; and the making, publication or circulation of material with intent to incite any class of persons to commit an offence against another class of persons""

... to be safe, better not write about (such as criticism), if you have any affiliations with or funding from foreign sources (Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill)

… cannot write about an on going court case or police investigation? (Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill)

… cannot write about anything that may be deemed as harassment? (Protection from Harassment Act)

… cannot write about anything that may be deemed as defamatory? (Defamation Act)

… may not write about or use Lee Kuan Yew’s name or image or likeness in such a way as may be construed as “(not) accorded dignity and respect” (Guidelines of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY))

… cannot write about anything that may be construed as in some way, be related to “any evidence given, or any documents presented to the (Select) committee, or extracts“?

I hope you find the above layman’s guide useful.
